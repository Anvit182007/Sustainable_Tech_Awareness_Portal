            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Digital Carbon Footprint</h3>
                <p>It is estimated that the global digital footprint produces around 4% of total greenhouse gas emissions, similar to the aviation industry. As more devices connect to the internet, this number is expected to rise significantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Energy Consumption of Data Centers</h3>
                <p>Data centers consume about 2% of the world's total energy supply. This staggering amount emphasizes the need for energy-efficient technologies and practices within the tech industry.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stat">
                <h3>E-Waste Generation</h3>
                <p>Approximately 53.6 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated globally in 2019, with only 17% being recycled properly. This highlights the urgency of improving e-waste recycling and management systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Impact of Streaming</h3>
                <p>Streaming video services contribute to 60% of all downstream internet traffic, leading to increased energy consumption. Transitioning to more energy-efficient streaming technologies can help mitigate this impact.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Renewable Energy Usage</h3>
                <p>As of 2021, only about 30% of data centers utilize renewable energy sources. Increasing this percentage is essential for reducing the overall carbon footprint of digital technologies.Companies are now exploring options like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to meet their energy needs sustainably. Transitioning to renewable energy not only mitigates the environmental impact but also offers potential cost savings in the long run.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Telecommuting and Emissions</h3>
                <p>Remote work has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Studies indicate that if 50% of the U.S. workforce worked remotely half the time, it could save approximately 54 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually. This reduction is equivalent to taking 10 million cars off the road for a year. By embracing remote work, companies not only increase employee satisfaction but also contribute positively to the environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Sustainable Tech Adoption</h3>
                <p>A survey found that 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable brands. This demonstrates a growing demand for companies to adopt eco-friendly practices in their operations. The shift towards sustainability in tech not only meets consumer expectations but also drives innovation in the industry, as businesses explore greener technologies and practices.

            <div class="stat">
                <h3>Water Usage in Tech Production</h3>
                <p>The production of electronic devices requires substantial water resources. For example, manufacturing one smartphone can use up to 2,000 gallons of water. This highlights the water footprint of technology and the need for water-efficient production practices. As the demand for tech products continues to rise, implementing sustainable water management strategies is critical to minimize environmental impacts.
